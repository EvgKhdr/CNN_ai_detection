The 17th century marked a transformative period in Japanese history, characterized by the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate and the implementation of policies that would shape the nation for over two centuries. In 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu emerged victorious from decades of civil war and established his military government in Edo (modern-day Tokyo), ushering in what would become known as the Edo period.
One of the most significant developments of this era was Japan's gradual movement toward sakoku, or "closed country" policies. Following increasing concerns about European influence and the spread of Christianity, the Tokugawa government enacted a series of edicts that severely restricted foreign contact. By 1639, almost all Europeans except the Dutch were expelled, and Japanese citizens were forbidden from traveling abroad. The Dutch were confined to the small artificial island of Dejima in Nagasaki harbor, where they conducted limited trade under strict supervision.
Despite this isolation, 17th-century Japan experienced remarkable internal development. The absence of major warfare after decades of conflict allowed society to stabilize and prosper. The rigid social hierarchy of samurai, farmers, artisans, and merchants became firmly established, though paradoxically, the merchant class—officially the lowest rank—grew increasingly wealthy through domestic commerce.
Urban culture flourished during this period. Edo grew into one of the world's largest cities, while Kyoto and Osaka became centers of arts and commerce. The kabuki theater emerged as popular entertainment, ukiyo-e woodblock prints began to develop, and the haiku poetry form was refined by masters like Matsuo Bashō, who traveled throughout Japan in the latter part of the century.
The economy transformed as well. Agricultural productivity increased through improved techniques and land reclamation. A sophisticated financial system developed with rice serving as a medium of exchange alongside currency. Road networks expanded, facilitating domestic trade and communication between regions.
Christianity, which had gained perhaps 300,000 converts by the early 1600s, was brutally suppressed. The Shimabara Rebellion of 1637-1638, involving Christian peasants and samurai, was crushed, reinforcing the government's determination to eliminate foreign religious influence.
This century of consolidation and isolation set Japan on a unique path, allowing it to develop a distinctive culture while remaining largely untouched by the global changes sweeping through other parts of Asia and Europe. The foundations laid during these hundred years would persist until the arrival of Commodore Perry's black ships in 1853 finally reopened Japan to the world.
