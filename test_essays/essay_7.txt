The plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, has shaped human history like few other diseases. This devastating illness has manifested in several major pandemics, leaving profound marks on civilization, culture, and demographics across continents.
The most infamous outbreak was the Black Death of the 14th century, which swept through Europe, Asia, and North Africa between 1347 and 1353. This catastrophic pandemic killed an estimated 75 to 200 million people—roughly one-third of Europe's population. The disease arrived via trade routes from Asia, carried by fleas living on black rats aboard merchant ships. Medieval societies, lacking understanding of disease transmission, were helpless against its rapid spread.
Plague typically presents in three forms: bubonic, characterized by painful, swollen lymph nodes called buboes; septicemic, which infects the bloodstream; and pneumonic, affecting the lungs and spreading through respiratory droplets. Without treatment, bubonic plague kills approximately 60% of victims, while pneumonic plague is nearly always fatal.
The Black Death's impact extended far beyond mortality. Labor shortages following the pandemic shifted economic power toward workers, contributing to the decline of feudalism. The catastrophe also influenced art, literature, and religious thought, as survivors grappled with mass death and divine justice.
While plague evokes images of medieval horror, it hasn't disappeared. The disease still occurs in various regions, with the World Health Organization reporting thousands of cases annually, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Modern antibiotics like streptomycin have made plague treatable when caught early, reducing mortality dramatically.
