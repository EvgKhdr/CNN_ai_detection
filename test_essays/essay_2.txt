Isaac Newton was one of the most influential scientists in history and a key figure in the Scientific Revolution. Born in 1643 in Woolsthorpe, England, Newton made groundbreaking contributions to physics, mathematics, and astronomy that shaped the way we understand the natural world. His ideas laid the foundation for classical science and are still taught and used today.

Newton is best known for formulating the laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. These laws explained how objects move on Earth and in space, unifying celestial and terrestrial mechanics for the first time. According to legend, Newton was inspired to think about gravity after observing an apple fall from a tree, leading him to question why objects are pulled toward the ground. His work showed that the same force causing the apple to fall also governs the motion of planets around the Sun.

In mathematics, Newton was a co-inventor of calculus, a powerful tool used to analyze change and motion. Calculus became essential for advances in science and engineering, allowing scientists to solve complex problems involving speed, acceleration, and growth. Although there was controversy over priority with the German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, both are now credited for developing calculus independently.

Newton also made important contributions to optics. He demonstrated that white light is composed of different colors and built the first practical reflecting telescope, improving astronomical observation. His findings were published in his famous book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, often referred to as the Principia, which is considered one of the most important scientific works ever written.

Beyond his scientific achievements, Newton was known for his intense focus and solitary nature. He later served as President of the Royal Society and Master of the Royal Mint. Isaac Newton’s work transformed science and remains a cornerstone of modern understanding of the physical universe.
